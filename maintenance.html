<p>Hi Jellyfish！

<p>Thank you all for your support to the website. Although we've experienced a "slight" congestion, we've successfully passed the first day! Now, it's time for some system maintenance, and the website may temporarily be unavailable.  We understand that there are still many buddies who haven't been able to subscribe successfully. Don't worry, our super IT squad is working tirelessly to fix the issues as quickly as possible.  If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us.

<p>Thank you for your patience and support, let's look forward to the website's return soon together!
